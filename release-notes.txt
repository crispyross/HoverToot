**HoverToot 2.0.1**

Allows you to toot by just hovering over the notes.
Tested on game versions 1.086x - 1.087 beta.

• By default, toggles on/off using F7.
• Achievement progress, high scores, and toot coins are not saved on performances where you have toggled HoverToot on.
• Config file is located at BepInEx/config/org.crispykevin.hovertoot.cfg.
    • Config can also be changed in-game if you have the TrombSettings mod.
    • To make HoverToot sound more legato and natural-sounding, you may increase EarlyStartDistance and LateEndDistance. For songs with rapid notes, some tweaking may be needed to prevent losing combo.
• Since you can't control your breathing while enabled, the Circular Breathing mod may be useful.
